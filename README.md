- **Express.js** – Web framework for handling routes and middleware  
- **MongoDB & Mongoose** – Database and ODM for data storage and management  
- **EJS** – Templating engine for rendering views  
- **JWT (JSON Web Token)** – Authentication and session management  
- **Multer** – Middleware for handling image uploads  
- **bcrypt & crypto** – For password hashing and security
